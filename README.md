Sam's team has scored the following numbers of goals in recent games

2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 2, 2, 3

Sam put the numbers in order, then added up:

frequency distribution
how often 1 occurs (2 times),
how often 2 occurs (5 times),
etc,
and wrote them down as a Frequency Distribution table.

From the table we can see interesting things such as

getting 2 goals happens most often
only once did they get 5 goals
